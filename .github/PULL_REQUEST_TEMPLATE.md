### This is an unofficial fork of yt-dlp.

*Please consider submitting your pull request to the official repository* [yt-dlp/yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pulls). While you are still welcome to submit pull request here, it would be advantageous to contribute to the official repository instead of this fork. Any pull request merged into the official repository will end up in this fork in a day or two, and far more people will benefit from pull requests submitted to the official repository.

That being said, youâ€™re welcome to contribute here, as long as you are aware of the fact that **this is an unofficial fork**.
