### This is an unofficial fork of yt-dlp.
=======
<!--
    **IMPORTANT**: PRs without the template will be CLOSED
    
    Due to the high volume of pull requests, it may be a while before your PR is reviewed.
    Please try to keep your pull request focused on a single bugfix or new feature.
    Pull requests with a vast scope and/or very large diff will take much longer to review.
    It is recommended for new contributors to stick to smaller pull requests, so you can receive much more immediate feedback as you familiarize yourself with the codebase.

    PLEASE AVOID FORCE-PUSHING after opening a PR, as it makes reviewing more difficult.
-->

*Please consider submitting your pull request to the official repository* [yt-dlp/yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pulls). While you are still welcome to submit pull request here, it would be advantageous to contribute to the official repository instead of this fork. Any pull request merged into the official repository will end up in this fork in a day or two, and far more people will benefit from pull requests submitted to the official repository.
